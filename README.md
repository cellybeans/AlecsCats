## Summary
This mod started as a simple cat conversion from unused base-game assets and has grown into a full pet system with:
- Taming + ownership
- Capture/spawn with persistent appearance variants
- Command controls (Follow, Hold, Recall, Move To Ping, Set Home, Return Home, Attack Target)
- Happiness/needs simulation with resource seeking
- Passive companion breeding
- Trait generation and inheritance for bred companion cats
- Multi-language localization

## Requirements
- **Alec's Tamework!** `2.10.x` dependency is required (Alechilles:Alec's Tamework!) for parent-line breeding role inheritance and pre-1.9.0 eye attachment migration.

## Craftable Items
### Cat Collar (Capture/Spawn Item)
- 3x Light Leather
- 1x Gold Bar
- Bench: Workbench Tier 2 (Tinkering)

### Cat Treat Bag (Command Item)
- 2x Light Leather
- 5x Raw Fish
- 5x Raw Meat
- Bench: Workbench Tier 2 (Tinkering)

## Quick Start
1. Find a wild cat.
2. Feed raw fish to make it friendly.
3. Use a **Cat Collar** to capture/tame it.
4. Place your cat from the **Soul Lantern** item.
5. Use one of these control methods:
   - Interact directly to cycle basic modes (Follow / Defend / Stay).
   - Use the **Cat Treat Bag** for advanced commands.

## Cat Treat Bag (Command Item)
- **Left click on a cat**: link/unlink that cat to the bag.
- **Right click**: open command selection wheel.
- **Left click (while not targeting link action)**: execute selected command on linked cats.

Default commands:
- Follow
- Hold
- Recall
- Move To Ping
- Set Home
- Return Home
- Attack Target

Notes:
- Commands require ownership + tamed cats by default.

## Taming and Ownership
- Taming assigns ownership.
- Only the owner can interact with/store the cat by default.
- When stored in an item, ownership can be cleared until re-spawn (trading-friendly flow).
- Owner damage/invulnerability behavior is controlled by Tamework companion config:
  - Alec's Cats!\Server\Tamework\Companion\ACCompCat.json

## Happiness and Needs
- Happiness fluctuates based on if the Cat's needs are being met
- Cats will automatically eat raw fish or Tamework Carnivore Kibble from storage containers nearby
- Tamework Carnivore Kibble can also be used as backup hand-feed, but it is less satisfying than their preferred food
- Cats will automatically drink water from water sources nearby
- Cats prefer to have at least one cat friend nearby, but don't like to be overcrowded
- Cats like when their owner is nearby

## Breeding and Traits
- Cats can automatically breed if they are happy and have a suitable partner
- Cats can spawn with 0-4 traits
- Traits can alter anything from size, to strength, to fertility and more
- Traits can be inherited from parents, and breeding cats with the same traits together can result in higher trait values (or lower!)
- Fur and eye color are also inherited from parents
- Body type roles can be inherited from either parent, with a small chance of a different body type appearing as a mutation

## Spawns
Cats are uncommon but not extremely rare.
- Mediumhair: Zone 1 Plains and Forests
- Shorthair: Zone 2 Oasis, Plateau, and Savanna
- Bobtail: Zone 1 Mountains, Zone 2 Plateau, and Zone 3 Mountains

They usually spawn solo, but can spawn in small groups.

## Color Variants
#### _All cat textures are now made by an artist far more skilled than me, [Celly (@Excel Lynt)](https://www.curseforge.com/members/excel_lynt/)._

Eye colors are separate randomized attachments, so cats can inherit eyes independently from coat color.

Eye variants include standard colors plus rare odd-eye combinations, including orange-yellow.

- Default black/white
- Missy (Darker Dust Kitty)
- Nyxie (Lighter Dust Kitty with a few white spots)
- Silver Tabby
- Orange Tabby
- Brown Tabby
- White
- Cream
- Cream Tuxedo
- Gray Tuxedo
- Brown Tuxedo
- Light Orange Tabby Tuxedo
- Black
- Snowshoe
- Cream Semi-Tabby
- Dark Gray Tabby
- Siamese

## Body Types
- Mediumhair
- Longhair
- Shorthair
- Bobtail
