# Changelog

All notable changes to **Alec's Cats!** will be documented in this file.

## 1.9.0 - Body Types + Eye Variants - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Wired mediumhair, longhair, shorthair, and bobtail cat body roles into Tamework companion, interaction, command, spawner, needs, happiness, trait, and breeding configs.
- Cat breeding now uses Tamework parent-line role inheritance so offspring can inherit either parent's body role, with a rare body-role mutation chance.
- Added separate randomized eye attachments for cat appearances.
- Added a new orange-yellow odd-eye variant.
- Added a Tamework attachment migration config that maps pre-1.9.0 coat selections to matching original eyes for existing cats.
- Cat breeding can now inherit eye selections from parents independently from coat selections.

### Changed
- Updated the required Alec's Tamework dependency to `2.10.x` for parent-line breeding role inheritance and attachment migration support.
- Defined body-type-specific coat and eye weighting for shorthair and bobtail cats.
- Updated wild cat spawn distribution so shorthair and bobtail body types appear in matching world regions.
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.9.0`.

## 1.8.2 - Carnivore Kibble + Sit Transition Cleanup - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- Pet cats now accept Tamework Carnivore Kibble for hand-feeding and nearby-container hunger refills, with the same generic-feed happiness penalty used for Animal Husbandry predators.
- Updated the required Alec's Tamework dependency to `2.8.x` to match Carnivore Kibble support.
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.8.2`.

### Fixed
- Pet cats now clear their wander sit posture before command-driven follow/defend/move transitions so interrupted idle sits no longer slide across the ground.

## 1.8.1 - Spawner Icon Correction - 2026-04-13
### Fixed
- Replaced the four newly added coat override spawner icons with proper generated icon assets for Snowshoe, Cream Semi-Tabby, Dark Gray Tabby, and Siamese.

- Renamed the cat spawner config asset from `AlecsCats_Spawner_Cat` to `ACSpawnCat`, keeping the coat-override spawner mapping for both `Cat` and `Cat_Pet`.

- New Silver Tabby Cat skin created by Excel Lynt has been added

## 1.5.7 - Sleep Wake Origin + Breeding Cooldown Format - 2026-03-14
### Changed
- `Template_Cat_Pet` sleep wake routing now preserves sleep origin: waking returns to `Idle` when sleep started from idle/follow, and returns to `Hold` when sleep started from hold.
- `TwBreedingConfig_AlecsCats_Cat_Pet` now uses `Cooldowns.BaseCooldownMinutes` (instead of seconds) for clearer cooldown tuning, matching the newer Tamework breeding config format.

## 1.5.6 - UpdateChecker + Docs Polish - 2026-03-11
### Added
- Added CurseForge update-check metadata in `manifest.json` (`UpdateChecker.CurseForge = 1432112`) so supported clients can detect newer versions.

### Changed

- Improved README content clarity and refreshed project shields/badges.

## 1.5.5 - Release Prep Patch - 2026-03-08
### Changed
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.5.5`.

## 1.5.4 - Tamework 2.2 Release Alignment - 2026-03-07
### Changed
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.5.4`.
- Updated required Tamework dependency to `Alechilles:Alec's Tamework! = 2.2.x`.

### Fixed
- Ensured `manifest.json` `ServerVersion` remains lowercase format for compatibility.

## 1.5.3 - Spawner Left/Right Click - 2026-03-02
### Added
- New cats-scoped Tamework configs for happiness, needs, and breeding:
  - `Server/Tamework/Happiness/TwHappinessConfig_AlecsCats_Cat_Pet.json`
  - `Server/Tamework/Needs/TwNeedsConfig_AlecsCats_Cat_Pet.json`
  - `Server/Tamework/Breeding/TwBreedingConfig_AlecsCats_Cat_Pet.json`
- New cats-scoped trait config:
  - `Server/Tamework/Traits/TwTraitConfig_AlecsCats_Cat_Pet.json`

### Changed
- Cats can now be captured and spawned with both left and right click
- `Template_Cat_Pet` now integrates Tamework needs-seek sensor/action behavior (`NeedsSeekWater`, `NeedsSeekFood`) and breeding pair movement (`BreedPair`) states.
- Added state-transition cleanup so status animations are cleared when moving between hold/sleep/needs and locomotion states.
- `Cat_Pet` now defines flock compatibility (`FlockArray: ["Cat_Pet"]`) so breeding family flocks can form for companion cats.

### Fixed
- `ServerVersion` format in `manifest.json` (Must be lower case)

## 1.5.2 - Cat Wander + Ambient Behavior Polish - 2026-02-23
### Changed
- `Template_Cat_Pet` now uses `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Wander` in `Idle` state, causing pet cats to wander within the template's `WanderRadius`.
- Follow behavior is restored as an explicit `Follow` state using `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Advanced`; interaction mode cycling, taming state assignment, and command-item `Follow`/`Recall` flows now route to `Follow` instead of `Idle`.
- `Template_Cat_Pet` now maps Hold posture/flavor/sleep parameters into Wander settle behavior, allowing cats to occasionally sit, play flavor idles, and sleep while in wander mode.
- `Template_Cat_Pet` now maps a Wander settle-exit transition (`StandUp` with delay) to avoid cats sliding while still in sit posture when resuming movement.
- Hold posture timing defaults are tuned (`SleepDelayAfterHoldEnterRange`, `SleepDelayAfterLastSleepRange`, `HoldStillWeight`, `HoldStillDurationRange`) so cats spend longer settled between flavor idles.

## 1.5.1 - Cat Treat Bag Crafting Fix - 2026-02-19
### Fixed

## 1.5.0 - Command Item System + Update 3.1 Compatibility - 2026-02-19

- Command-item localization keys (`items.AlecsCats_Command_Item.*`) across all supported locales.

### Changed
- `Template_Cat_Pet` now includes `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Command_Move` so command move/home hooks can drive movement behavior.
- Cat command flow now uses Tamework command selection/dispatch pipeline (including radial menu selection and linked-NPC command routing).

### Fixed
- Added missing non-English command-item language lines in locale `server.lang` files.
- Updated manifest `ServerVersion` to `2026.02.19-1A311A592` for latest server compatibility.

### Changed

- Interaction particles/icons now come from **Alec's Tamework!** assets (client must load the Tamework assets pack).
- Per-world item config overrides load from:
  `<UserData>/Saves/<World>/mods/Alec's Cats!/Tamework_Items_Config.json` (auto-created empty; leave empty to inherit defaults).

### Tamed behavior
- Click with the cat in your hand to place it in the world.
